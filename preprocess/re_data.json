To move in you will need the first month's rent + 1.5x security deposit. The application is free, once you're conditionally approved we ask for a $30 charge for every adult to pay for your credit check. We usually allow pets with an upfront one time fee of $400/pet, please discuss our pet policy with one of our staff members as it can be different based on the kind of pet you own. We don?t have a fixed minimum credit score. If you believe you can be a great tenant but you are unsure about your credit score, please talk to one of our staff members. We take section 8 for some of our units, ask a staff member for a specific apartment."
