<q>Hi Abe! Is the roofer still coming today? I am not working from home today but I don&#39;t think I need to be there. Also I just wanted to share with you the few things left that I know need to be done. The light in the downstairs bathroom over the sink needs to be replaced it has not worked since we moved in. U believe it&#39;s just the bulb.... the fridge is not hooked up to the water so the features aren&#39;t working (not sure if this was intentional or not)... the leak in the basement needs to be identified (not sure if the hvac guy you sent over last week was able to find it. He didn&#39;t say anything when he left) and the utility sink and pipe beneath it still need to be replaced and/or looked at. The pipe leaks so we aren&#39;t able to hook up washing machine at this Time. I&#39;ll most likely be working from home on Wednesday if you want to meet in person about anything</q>

<q>Yes the roofer is scheduled to come by today. the light I will likely have to replace it&#39;s probably a loose connection. I tried speaking with the plumber yesterday you can give me a clear answer as to the leak but he&#39;s supposed to get back to me with a price to do everything. We originally intended to install a fridge without a water dispenser (ice makers and water dispensers break frequently so we avoid using them) but being that we have a plumber coming already to do a bunch of other work we will connect it</q>
