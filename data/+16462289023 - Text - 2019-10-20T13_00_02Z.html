<q>Good Morning, my wife and I viewed your home on Chapel Avenue and met with the current tenants during our viewing and we are more than interested.  We would like to move into the property.  Please let us know when you would be able to further discuss the possibilities. </q>

<q>2100/mo, no parking but it&#39;s directly across a side street. Street parking is easy. What&#39;s your email address? I can send photos, we&#39;re putting on the market on Tuesday</q>

<q>This is very disappointing news as Chapel Avenue had everything we were looking for including the moving time and the cost.  We work in NYC so parking is essential.  We also were not trying to pay over 2k because we are looking to purchase a home within the next year like Esther and Omar.  Our current rental was sold last month and the owner has decided to move in.  We have until October 31, to move out.  Our current residence is designed just like 312 Chapel.  Nevertheless my email is Koryymcbride@yahoo.com you can send the information </q>

<q>A realtor showed us the property last Saturday.  The issue I had was paying the brokers fee.  In looking to purchase a home I could not afford to pay that extra amount.  My wife then saw the listing on Trulia and we have trying to reach you since last night I saw Omar and that was how I got in contact with you.  The number listed on the website stated it wasn&#39;t their work hours.  When was this property rented it had to be this week.</q>

<q>Agents don&#39;t normally do that, we only know that they&#39;re showing a client. I need to check with my broker to see if there are any issues. In the meantime what&#39;s your approx annual household income and credit score?</q>
