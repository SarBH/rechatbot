"Hi Aretha sure absolutely, please note one of the bedrooms is accessible only through the building stairwell or the master bedroom in the unit"
Do you think the layout would work for a couple with a toddler?
"It's perfect for a couple with a toddler-- you can see floor plan at asdprop.com tannin can use what's marked as master bedroom as a living room instead. So eat in kitchen, dining room, living room"

"Hi, I am interested about it, but not sure if you might keep it until August 28th."
feels like I might be looking too soon
"Normally that would be too far out, but if you don't mind me asking, what's your annual income and approx credit score? For the right tenant we can wait a bit"
Oh Ok cool. My annual is 143k. My credit score is 769
I think we may be able to work something out-- when would you like to tour?
Cool. I am available tomorrow. We can have it tomorrow if it works for you
"sorry, does Sunday work? Maybe at 11?"
Yeah. It works too. Thanks
"Can you please send me the apartment link again, just confirm we are on the same page"

It looks great
Thank you!!!! It's one of the better looking apartments we've done. Stove was recently installed too
Awesome!!! Thanks
Quick question. I see there is a $50 gas fee each month. How about electricity?
"Electric is paid separately, that 50 is for heat and hot water"
Ok
Any parking available?
"There's street parking available, is usually very easy to find a spot. there's also a parking lot up the street I think they charge like 50 bucks a month, but honestly it's not necessary"
I'm sorry I have to run but I'd be happy to talk tomorrow night if you have any more questions
Ok. Thank you for the details. Parking is my n1 feature
"Hi Bienvenue, would 2:30 today be possible? Thanks"
"100 Clerk St, Jersey City NJ"
"Looking forward, thanks!"
Thanks. Will be there
"On my way, see you there in a bit"
Sure. thkx

"Hi, you called regarding an apartment?"
"Hi Vamsi, this is Abe from 649 Ocean Ave, you were speaking with my partner saul about our apartment. We have showings available 10-1pm on Tuesday and 5-7pm on Thursday. What times work for you?"
Hi Porscha you can see photos of the unit and apply online at asdprop.com
"Hi Porscha, please let me know if you're interested, if not I will remove you from our list. Thanks"
Hi. I'm Charly Mampuya. Would like to receive more details or visit the apt 649 Ocean Ave #3. Thanks
"Hi Charly, sure, what would you like to know?"
"Hi Abe, is 649 ocean avenue still available?"
"Yes we have two units there, what's your name?"
Michael Patterson 
"Hi Michael thanks for reaching out, are you interested in the third floor for 1800 or the first floor for 1600? Both have three bedrooms and central AC. Third floor has a private bathroom in the master suite"
"I did not see the listing for the first floor, but have interest in it. Does the first floor unit have  2 bathrooms as well? What is the sf?"
"First floor has one bathroom, maybe 750 square feet. It's the same floor as the garage so it's a bit smaller than the third floor"
"It's not on the market yet, we haven't gotten a chance to photograph it"
Newly renovated
"Ok. The third floor is more interesting to me with the additional bathroom. I own an advertising company with franchises in multiple states. My full time residence is in Washington DC with my wife and son, but I spend 10-14 days in New Jersey/ny every two weeks. I own my own home and would be renting with my regional manager from the dc area (he would be moving full time, while I am there roughly half of each month). My credit is excellent and approval shouldn't be an issue of any type. Is the parking street parking only? "
"We are actually using the garage in this building as a storage unit, we would be happy to rent it to you for 300/mo. To be honest though street parking is not an issue"
Are you familiar with the neighborhood?
"Not entirely - I had a rental in jersey city previously and the building was condemned after a fire, but I am familiar with the area "
Can you send info on the first unit when you have it - I may be interested in the first and the garage 
craigslist secret code for abe@asdprop.com is 82420. Do not share this code for any reason. Any request for it is a scam.

"Hi Gerly you received your message regarding 100 clerk Street, would you like to set up a tour? Thanks, Abe"
"Hello , I would like to know how many deposits I have to make in order to move in?"
"We require first month's rent and 1 and a half month security deposit, so  $4250 total"
"Isn't it 1,700 monthly the rent ? How it went up to 4,250?"
1700(first month)+2550(1.5mo security)=4250
Ohh I didn't see that u said two months of rent okay 
"Right now I'm at work okay, as soon as I can I give you a call "
"I spoke with you earlier this morning. My buyer would like to see 312 Chapel on Sunday around 12:30 and understands they can't get into the other two units. Can this work? Thanks, Colleen Rooney, Prominent Properties"

HelloMy name is Calvin. I’m interested in the place you have listed for 801 Madison st. I would be willing to take over your lease at the end of this month if you could get it extended to 12/30. Let me know if possible. Also would like to view place. Thanks!
"Hi Calvin I should be able to do that, can you forward me your rough financial info so I can forward to my landlord? Thanks. My email is abe@asdprop.com"
"Evening, exactly what financial info? Also would my name be going on the lease or just sub leasing through you?"
Ideally an assignment but up to my landlord-- I'm not sure exactly but I want to put something in front of them that will make sure ure there isn't any issue. if it would make you more comfortable I can just go in front of them with whatever your stated income and assets are
Well I would like to meet you in person and see the apartment before we transfer that type of info. Most likely I’ll pay the rent up front to avoid those extras since it’s a short lease.
What's your annual income?
Enough to pay the rent.
"I don't want to waste your time or mine, are you above $110K?"
Yes
"Ok great, what time tomorrow works for you?"
I can come anytime after 4pm
Good morning i saw your ad about 3 bedroom is it still available by any chance
"Hi, did I get back to you? 649 ocean"
Oh ok do you have pictures 
Asdprop.com
I'm upstate ny do you do transfer 
Transfer?
I have section 8 in a different state
I think that needs to be handled on your end. As long as it isn't a huge time delay it should not be a problem
Ok 
Would you like to tour/apply?
"Please let me know if you're interested, thanks"
I'm interested I'll come out to see it on the 21
Does 5pm on the 21st work? What's your name?

I'm busy 2-5
Ok 5 it is
"ok great, whats your name?"
Sherlla

Hi Abe.  This is steven with insula Capital Group.  Can you confirm your email as abe@asdprop.com
Yup
Okay ty. 
Good evening Abe was wondering if the apts on Craigslist are still available 
312 chapel or 649 ocean?
Ocean 
Yup still available. Are you in area to tour?
Not at the moment 
And you accept section 8 correct ? 
"Ok, how about Tuesday @noon?"
6458 -- just a heads up construction is still going on so the hallway is a mess
I have finished showing. Really nice . I will bring more clients here I guess.
Great! Would they like to submit an application?
They will think about it and tell me 
"Hi Kia, this is Abe from 85 Woodlawn. Would you like to tour tomorrow? Photos and application at asdprop.com thanks"
"Hi Kia, please let me know if you're still looking for an apartment or if I should stop following up. Thanks"
Sorry Abe been busy I'm sorry but definitely tomorrow I'll have it for u 
Would you like to set up a tour?

"Hi Amir thanks for taking my call, this is Abe from ASD Property Group. Your tenant Ashley Jones from 33 Fulton is applying to one of my units and I wanted to get some feedback on her. Please call me back whenever you have the chance"
"Good Morning, my wife and I viewed your home on Chapel Avenue and met with the current tenants during our viewing and we are more than interested.  We would like to move into the property.  Please let us know when you would be able to further discuss the possibilities. "
I saw your property on tulia as well and wanted to act immediately. 
Trulia (renter app) 
Hi I'm sorry but it's been rented-- it's still showing somewhere as available online?
"We have another renovated unit coming available at 85 Woodlawn, it's a 3bed duplex, is that something that might work?"
What is the cost and does it have parking?  
"2100/mo, no parking but it's directly across a side street. Street parking is easy. What's your email address? I can send photos, we're putting on the market on Tuesday"
"This is very disappointing news as Chapel Avenue had everything we were looking for including the moving time and the cost.  We work in NYC so parking is essential.  We also were not trying to pay over 2k because we are looking to purchase a home within the next year like Esther and Omar.  Our current rental was sold last month and the owner has decided to move in.  We have until October 31, to move out.  Our current residence is designed just like 312 Chapel.  Nevertheless my email is Koryymcbride@yahoo.com you can send the information "
"Hi Kory, I'm sorry did you walk through the unit with us? I dont have you in our system"
A realtor showed us the property last Saturday.  The issue I had was paying the brokers fee.  In looking to purchase a home I could not afford to pay that extra amount.  My wife then saw the listing on Trulia and we have trying to reach you since last night I saw Omar and that was how I got in contact with you.  The number listed on the website stated it wasn't their work hours.  When was this property rented it had to be this week.
Justyna Walynsky showed us the property.  Did she not put our names in the listing?  We had a scheduled viewing Saturday at 10:00am on October 12th
"Agents don't normally do that, we only know that they're showing a client. I need to check with my broker to see if there are any issues. In the meantime what's your approx annual household income and credit score?"
We earn a combined 180k.  Regarding credit it's good but I was waiting for our official house hunt to receive our credit approval etc 
Abe@asdprop.com

Hello. I've filled out an application for the first floor unit at 211 Linden Avenue. Will renting the unit at $1450 be an issue? I'm waiting on the section 8 
case manager to respond to my email about the apartment price being that the utilities are separate. 
1450 is going to be very difficult I know we will likely have a problem passing rent study even at 1500. Can you have your case manager call me?
I can give you her information so you can contact her tomorrow. 
Ok sure
