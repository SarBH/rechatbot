<q>Hello Abe,<br><br>No one will be home at this time and we are not comfortable with someone viewing the space with us not being there being that our things  are still in the apartment. We stated that we would be there until the end of your lease so we would respect if we were told ahead of time to make proper arrangements to be home and at least present, we both work during the week. <br><br></q>

<q>We received this email on Saturday at 8:03 pm, which is a weekend and what&#39;s reasonable to you may not be for us being that I am dealing with a high risk pregnancy. Also I can not take off of work because something was communicated on a weekend.  We don&#39;t mind the apartment being viewed but once again we will not be home. We are trying our best to communicate with you properly and be respectful but once again we are not just sitting around the house so we would respect you at least asking if we will be home and present before you agree to showing a space we are still occupying at the moment so we can both have a MUTUAL understanding. </q>

<q>Im sorry I don&#39;t have any email, or a phone call or text message asking us for time slots. If that was the case I would have of course communicated properly to accommodate the viewing. During this week it is tough <br>for us due to obligations we have at work but the weekend works being that I am off. </q>
