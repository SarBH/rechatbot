<q>Hey Abe I don&#39;t know what that guy came to do yesterday about the flood in the basement but there&#39;s still no hot water and this is day 2. I also spoke to you numerous times about the notice infestation that&#39;s going on and you have yet to get someone to exterminate or patch these holes up. My kids and I can not continue to live under terms conditions and this is unfair to us. </q>

<q>If there are mice, it&#39;s because you are throwing food off the side of the building instead of putting trash bags in designated bins. Per your lease, you are responsible for pest control. Call an exterminator</q>

<q>Let&#39;s be honest Your apartment was already mice infested before I got there. My home is very clean inside and out there no way in hell I would tolerate a dirty environment for my family nor myself. And I not continue to live under these conditions. I specifically spoke to you about the basement flooding and there not having no hot water. You told me that the plumber was coming to address the situation after the fact that you told me to go down in the basement myself to handle the situation. Every time I contact you about a problem about your property you either tell me to handle it myself or take your time to address and properly handle the situation. I have kids and we SHOULD NOT AND WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LIVE LIKE THIS. Being that this seem to be an issue every single time I call you with unhealthy issues I will call the city to inspect this house top to bottom and we will see how &quot;safe&quot; it is because I&#39;m sick and tired of complaining. </q>

<q>I sent you down before, not after he was there, because you told me that water was spilling out of the house on to the street. I think you might be happier in another house. If you would like to move out, we can terminate your lease without penalty.</q>
