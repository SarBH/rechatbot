<q>Good morning Abe, just want to give you a heads up on what going on. I currently work as a security guard in New York and they made a ban for only essential workers are allowed to be working right now because of the virus. Since I am a security guard I am considered an essential worker but I am also 8 months pregnant so my job told me I needed to stop working earlier then I planned too. I will most likely have April&#39;s rent but because of the way they have to file my paper work I&#39;m not sure how the following months will be. My mother has also been taken out of work because she is sick and needs to be cleared before she can be put back on the schedule. I do apologize for this but the situation is really out of my hands at this point.</q>

<q>No problem, I understand. You need to file for unemployment in NY ASAP, they are extending benefits for people due to the virus. We will work with you as much as we can, thanks for contacting ahead of rent due date. Let me know what you would like to do after april (we could for example spread may and june&#39;s rent payments over the remainder of your term).</q>

<q>ah I see-- basically, instead of paying May&#39;s rent in full, you can pay half and the rest of May&#39;s rent spread over each month until the end of your term. Same thing with June if needed</q>
