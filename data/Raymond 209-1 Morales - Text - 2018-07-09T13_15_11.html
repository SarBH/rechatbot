<q>Hi Raymond, not sure who you spoke with from Sec8, but they don&#39;t have anything to do with this. Im trying to work with you. I&#39;m not asking for any fee for you to break your lease. In return, I need to be able to have another tenant lined up so I don&#39;t lose thousands of  dollars to lost rent, broker commissions, and turn around costs. We can either (a) Block off a couple of hours a week to show your unit, or (b) charge a termination fee equal to 1.5 months rent. let me know what you would like to do.</q>

<q>Heyyy sir... first off my mom did talk to her caseworker today. She is the one that signed the contract boss. So my mom is the one to make decisions and stuff. I just translate. We haven&#39;t broke the lease nor decided to leave. As I told you it is a high possibility due to her condition. We just wanted to give you the heads up in case this became reality. And of course sec8 has to approve it. It&#39;s not up to us... unless they say we can do it we can&#39;t simply break the lease. For the contract to be canceled my mom would need to write a letter and send it to you. You&#39;d sign it and then we&#39;d take that letter to sec8 and they would cancel the lease, obviously they&#39;d do that if the reason is powerful.Otherwise the contract still stands as it is sir. She doesn&#39;t authorize you to bring people to see the unit: first because we still living there , our stuff is still there , the lease still stands and the important reason that people she doesn&#39;t know can&#39;t be in and out of the apartment due to her condition. It&#39;s pretty bad , life threatening and we have prove of that to support that sir. </q>

<q>There isnt a termination option in the lease. Let me know if you decide to leave, both options are available if you need them</q>
